## Expository Data Analysis(EDA)- Excel
EDA involved exploring the Human Resources data to answer key questions, such as;
- How does employment status vary across different departments?
- What is the distribution of active employees by gender?
- Are there any notable patterns in absenteeism across departments or genders?
- How does the distribution of recruitment sources vary, and what is the gender breakdown within each source?
